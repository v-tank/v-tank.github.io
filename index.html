				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<hr size="3" color="#ccc">

				<img src="assets/images/prof-pic.png" alt="Vaibhav's Profile Picture" height="200px" width="200px" />

				<p>I’m a 24-year-young guy who still dreams like a 12 year-young kid.</p>

				<p>And although my childhood aspiration of being an astronaut did not come true, my journey so far has given me the opportunity to work on some very interesting projects.</p>

				<p>I am a recent Engineering graduate from San Jose State University. I enjoy being surrounded by technology and staying at the forefront of innovation, which is why I love the Silicon Valley. Robots fascinated me when I was younger, so I went on to focus my degree in that field. I worked on cool projects, developed tons of skills, and grew my network all the while working on my passions of web and app development, product management, and photography. I strongly believe that there is no end to improvement, which is why I constantly strive to self-teach new skills through online courses and by talking to friends.</p>

				<p>Making an impact on the world is important to me, which is why I decided to join the Tech force in the Silicon Valley in December 2017. I want to develop products that millions of people use and love. Currently, I’m enrolled in a coding bootcamp at UC Berkeley to help me sharpen my skills and jump into the Tech world.</p>

				<p>That’s just a little about me. Let’s talk so we can learn more about each other.</p>
